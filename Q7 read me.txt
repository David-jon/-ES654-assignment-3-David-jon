The code is taken from

I have used Snakes vs Dogs. I took 40 phots from snakes from the internet and 40 dog photos from Kaggle catsandogs.zip. Then I renamed all the snake photo to cats.0.jpg, cats.1.jpg....cats.39.jpg. I did this so that I don't have to make adjustments to the code.

Here are the 3 accuracies that I got

Vgg1 model = 50.0%
Vgg1 with data augmentation = 77%
vgg16 with transfer learning = 86%


As it takes a few minutes to train on my computer, I have provided ipynb file as it can store the outputs
