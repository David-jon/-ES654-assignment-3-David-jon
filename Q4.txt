Time complexity of training a logistic regression model is

Time_Complexity(Training): O((f+1)csE)

Time_Complexity(Testing): O(f+1)cs


Where the variables mean

f : number of features (+1 for bias)
c : number of classes
s : number of training examples in the dataset
E : number of epochs of gradient descent


For testing, we just multiply the matrixes only one time, it is independent of number of epochs
